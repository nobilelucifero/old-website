            <h3>Hello, dear reader!</h3>
            <p>
                This is a little studio I made for a job application which was already expired. But because it was fun and very interesting, I decided to go on and work on it anyway. I had very nice feedbacks by who I took this exercise from! So, let&#8217;s start with the premise.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The year is 2015 and we grown into an entertainment powerhouse.
                We dominate worldwide discovery for news, local event, apps, games, TV, and movies. Our next area is local discovery with a focus on phone­sized devices starting with iPhone.
                We do some user research and decide that the most natural way to go after local discovery is with a new stand­alone product taking an augmented reality approach: point your phone somewhere, and we overlay the world with context and actions.</strong>
            </p>
            <h4>I hope you&#8217;ll like this realization.</h4>

                Determine an interesting scene as your frame for the design. Why did you select this scene?

                <img src="resources/setting.jpg" alt="A photo from Rosenthaler Platz, Berlin">
            </p>
            <p>
                The scene I chose is Rosenthaler Platz, in Berlin. I imagine a tourist arriving right from the airport and one the first places they&#8217;ll reach can be Rosenthaler Platz. I wanted to display a setting that is likely to happen.
            </p>
            <p>
                I often see very improbable settings, focusing too much far or too much close to a place (panoramas or close-ups). I believe that choosing a more realistic scene will help the final design to be more convincing.

            <p>
                The context is a famous square in Berlin (as I just wrote). I chose to design the concept app in <strong>Portrait Mode</strong>, because I see the Landscape Mode good experience-speaking, and easier to integrate with iOS. <br>
                I also imagine a tourist (example) with a shopping bag or a baggage: would it be comfortable to hold the phone with&mdash;basically&mdash;two hands? <strong>Suppositions are not always right</strong>, but I find this one particularly accurate, in my opinion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Obviously, I&#8217;d like then to integrate a Landscape Mode since it could allow interesting functionalities to be displayed. Such as a micro map of the area, for example (which <a href="resources/outrageous-minimap.jpg" target="_blank">I tried</a> in portrait mode: the filename says it all).

            <p>
                For more nearby results, other than cluttering the visual with overlapping balloons, I opted to hide those other results behind the main one (nearest/more relevant). Since the concept is to have little cards to play with, arrange them as a deck was the most immediate and fun idea to play with. I think the outcome is quite nice!

                Tapping the balloon takes you directly to the full related result. The only step in between (or better, optional) I would add is a complete List of the Places nearby, not automatically updated, for obvious reasons. But in this iteration I wanted to keep the concept very straight-forward and easy to grasp. <strong>Shuffle the cards and then play with them</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The full page of the Item shows (in this case a Restaurant) different actions that can be performed on it. Actions like <strong>&laquo;Reserve a Table&raquo;</strong> add the possible value to the app. Ultra-specific actions like these would permit to have a true advantage on any <em>Maps</em> app out there, by building a business around these actions.

            <p>
                As I was writing, each item Item can have different specific actions. I used the <strong>&laquo;Reserve a Table&raquo;</strong> action as you suggested, but the custom actions could be more. Buying tickets for Events, redeem discounts for Shops, find books for Libraries and so on. It could be fun to find them all!
            </p>
            <p>
                The workflow I designed to Reserve a Table is pretty simple, but I&#8217;d like in the future to integrate more the online account with the App&#8217;s core functionalities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other actions instead usually point to the apps the user has installed. <strong>Directions</strong> takes to <em>Maps</em>, <strong>Website</strong> to <em>Safari</em> and so on. Rather than trying to do <em>everything</em> from only one&mdash;big&mdash;app, it&#8217;s better in my opinion to leave to further developments the implementation of such features.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    The main concept has been transferred into wireframe/PSD (at this stage they look basically the same). <br>
                    <strong>I realized</strong> after few moments that many thing didn't work out well as I expected. So I started iterating on what was problematic: icons, general poorness, and that meaningless Navigation Bar.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The first attemp was to iterate on the <strong>Balloons</strong>. I tried also the classical <em>horizontal</em> approach, but again, the result was just something between <em>poor</em> and&hellip; <em>meh</em>. <br>
                    I also started wondering if my space-saving compass (at the bottom) had any meaning at all. Short answer: <strong>no</strong>. <br>
                    It was difficult to design due to calculations to be made and even difficult in defining how it would behave, plus it was still obscure even to myself.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Now things look better</strong>. The new icons are clear enough, Balloons have finally a defined layout, the new compass it&#8217;s looking much more better and suggests his functionality at a first glimpse. I also implemented a <strong>Zoom Bar</strong> that let you see farther without moving (I realized this need for myself while testing real apps, such as Layar and Wikitude). <br>
                    Now it&#8217;s time to improve the overall look and make it more coherent compared to other Views.
                </li>
            </ol>

                <li>
                    Like for the <em>AR Camera View</em>, I started putting down the elements I had in mind. <br>
                    It was soon clear that the Google-ish look wasn't a nice fit for the App&#8217;s visual language, so it was clear I had to move away from it. Also, the <strong>&larr; Back</strong> was almost illegible even with a selected photo: time to rethink these details and bring a more polished look in stage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In this iteration, the page started to look in a way that I started to like. Anyway, fonts and the general assets were still too much heterogeneous. Also, many icons were looking out of place.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finally things started to look and feel better, in the proper place. However, some corrections on the icons and the on Header were still needed. So I did.

            <p>
                The main font used is Helvetica Neue. With this choice I can make the app feel more <em>native</em>, related to the OS itself. Like a bundled item.
                For technical reasons, in the Balloons, I opted for the Condensed variant in order to push as much characters as possible in the narrow container, without sacrificing the final legibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                Colors tend to be present, but they&#8217;re not overwhelming. The main stage is taken by the AR Camera View, so it wouldn&#8217;t make much sense to confuse the user with too many of them.

                I chose to give specific colors to the various scopes in order to make the badges more meaningful and to be able, one day, to decline the Result View with a specific color accent or with some other specific design choices.

                &laquo;Clean but meaningful&raquo; was the main theme guiding me through all the process. The discovery should be at first useful and, if possible, fun. The fun can be transmitted with nice interactions and rewarding/successful actions. <br>
                Discover a Restaurant and then being simply directed to the Maps won&#8217;t be enough to justify this kind of App&#8217;s existence.

                Explain what visual details you use and why. Be extremely meticulous here. Do you have an icon with a 1px border? Why? Is the context a semi­transparent background or solid color? Why? Do you use some extra details to make context and icons pop off the background scene? Would you use the same elements on a typical solid background such as what you deal with in an app? Why?

                I made icons look thin, but not too much. If a icon is on a semi-transparent background and it&#8217;s very thin (hairline thickness), it would be extremely difficult to comprehend. Imagine a bright scene under the sunlight. Hariline icons look cool just if you can see them clearly. <br>
                I used often outlined icons because iOS7 brings this concept. Obviously, I would like to unify more the look and feel of all the icons I designed, making the whole experience visually more coherent.
            </p>
            <p>
                Backgrounds for Balloons are solid. For spacing reasons the text needs to be smaller than usual. Making the background semi-transparent will just ruin the legibility. Also, a solid background permits me to justify the swipe carousel of the Balloons. <br>
                They also have a small triangle that helps the user to locate better the targets. Originally (you can see that from the sketches), I was thinking to link the Balloon and its target with a thin line, but I found it very difficult to see even in the mockups of the very first iterations, so I opted for a more classical bottom tip. I makes also more sense because the balloons behind could be slightly displaced than the front-facing result, and the tip helps the idea of "grouping".
            </p>
            <p>
                I made the background semi-transparent only in the Quick Settings View, to give the idea of actions very quick to perform and not out of context (the Augmented Reality Camera). The snapshot is fixed so the user can remember the position she/he was prior to change the settings. Also, it should help performances and possible battery drain (I think these apps generally consume quite a lot of resources).

                Augmented reality can feel like unnatural, scary, post­human scifi, or it can feel very natural and fun. How does your design make it feel natural and fun?

                I think you&#8217;re right pointing this out. I really long for AR (and menu-less) interfaces but, while they shine on movies and videogames, I see them still difficult to implement on small screens and where a lot of data has to be exposed without clutter the visual. Obviously, this is not an excuse for not trying it <em>today</em>. <br>
                A more traditional take on the App&#8217;s design could help the final user feel more at home.

                The feeling of fun is yet to be built. A <strong>100%</strong> fun, I mean. There are already some interactions (like the swipe through the Balloons, the moving compasses) that make it nice and natural to use. The real fun will come with rewards, discounts, easy in-context actions and a more characterized communication in the app itself. All of these features will make the App more fun to use. And definitely enjoyable.

                I felt I had to add this bonus "question". While I was designing all the screens, I start thinking what I could do more. But keeping iterating would just delay the deadline beyond my expectations. So: what would you like to change or improve in the next iterations of this App?
            </h4>
            <p>
                Let&#8217;s face it. This App is not perfect. Since this is more a proof-on-concept, a prototype, I fear it&#8217;s not well crafted everywhere. There could be some inconsistencies in the flow and ultimately the «Fun» factor has to be improved, other than minor/aesthetic details. I also believe we&#8217;ll need more data for this task. User are customers and discover what is interesting for them is not always a straight-forward process. Also, depending on the activities we want to focus, we might need to make partnerships or deals even with the local activities (POIs).

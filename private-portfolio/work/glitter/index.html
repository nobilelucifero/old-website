                Sometimes&mdash;in order to come up with the right ideas&mdash;you have to ask yourself the right questions. This is what I did while actually working on the following sketches and drawings.
                Key questions I came up with for myself are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>What's the temporal dimension of this Product?</li>
                <li>How are people supposed to interact and share content? (personal or not)</li>
                <li>Is the Card creation an encouraged process? Why? How?</li>
                <li>Do we care about creating a personal network of contacts? Or are these Cards supposed to not last long?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I can't really reply to these questions yet, but it's anyway interesting to start already pondering about these themes.

            <p>
                From now on, I'm going to reference <em>Business Cards</em> as <em>Glitter Cards</em> or simply <em>Cards</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cards! They can be shaped in so many ways&hellip; in the preparatory sketches they started as plain 'ol Business Cards, becoming at the end polygons or even 3D objects. <br>
                Unfortunately, I couldn't really organize the <strong>AI</strong> of these Cards in a meaningful or practical way, therefore they didn't make it in the final drawings. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                So, after trying a couple more shapes, I dediced to stick with rectangles or squares. Honestly, the "portrait" Cards I see in <strong>Glitter Alpha</strong> already pleases me (although sizes and proportions could be different).

            <p>
                Fitting these Cards within a System, Grid or Hieracy is not an easy task. I ended up imagining Glitter as a Inbox of incoming contacts, in which its temporal dimension is (relatively) short.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mainly, I see 3 to 4 main Sections useful to the App's purposes.
            </p>

            <h5>You (Profile)</h5>
            <p>
                I believe a spotlight of your own Card is always very helpful. The Business Card I will share the most is definitely my own one!
            </p>

            <h5>Inbox</h5>
            <p>
                This is most <strong>transitional Section</strong>. Incoming, fresh, Cards that are not sorted or archived are going to end up here.
            </p>

            <h5>From Your Networks (a.k.a. Discovery)</h5>
            <p>
                Probably the best way to engage users in the App is to let them <strong>discover possible now or already knows Contacts</strong>, or rather, a way to connect with them. <br>
                I can easily think about <strong>Homescreen App</strong>. Such a simple Discovery, yet amazingly satisfactory! ;)
            </p>

            <h5>Stored Contacts</h5>
            <p>
                I'm not very sure we would need such section in the main screen of the App, but I imagine it being useful when you want to <strong>share</strong> saved or archived Cards to others. <br>
                My fundamental concern here is privacy, but I'm probably overthinking about it already.

                        This was probably another fun part: I enjoyed it a lot! Writing some quick User Stories mafe me derive the most interesting ideas for this project, possibly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sharing has to be <strong>effective, fast and friction-less</strong> (probably also fun) to make this App successful. I definitely believe it's a result definitely possible to achieve.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In particular, <strong>Sharing Channels</strong> (the way you share) could dictate the way people interact with <strong>Glitter</strong>. I particularly liked to ability to share via SMS + deeplink (fast, cheap &amp; easy). There must be though alternative ways to do it otherwise. <br>
                        I quickly tried to outline the most common ones (without being sci-fi about it).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this Board I also got the idea of <strong>archiving</strong>. Which made me ask myself: how much these Cards are supposed to last in Glitter or in your Phone? Can Glitter become an extension of your Contacts App?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Last but not least: funny features! How about having the ability to create your own persona in identikit-style to make people interact a bit more with the App? Just an idea here. It might be only for avatars that accompany the Cards. :)

                I believe this only a tiny starting point&hellip; many other ideas flooded my mind, but I decided to put down on paper only few of them.
